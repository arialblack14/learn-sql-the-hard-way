##Learn SQL the Hard Way

####Introduction

I am following [theodinproject](http://http://www.theodinproject.com/web-development-101/databases?ref=lnav) as part of my attempt to better understand the various web development assets in order to be able to make web (or mobile) apps.

So, instead of going through the Stanford class "Introduction to Databases" (which i had completed when it was made available) i decided to do [learn SQL the Hard Way](http://sql.learncodethehardway.org/book/).
